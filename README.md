## education, modernized

Diplomacy is an application that comes with the growing addiction to technology such as cellphones and computers. Students in this modern world lose interest in classical learning and are gradually making the transition in schools from the ancient to the modern.

We decided to create Diplomacy because it is a necessity not have long-term, it is immediate.
